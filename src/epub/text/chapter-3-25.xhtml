			<p>Yesterday I passed by an elm avenue, leading to a beautiful old house. The road between the trees was covered in all its length and breadth with fallen leaves⁠—a carpet of pale gold. Further on, I came to a plantation, mostly of larches; it shone in the richest aureate hue, with here and there a splash of bloodred, which was a young beech in its moment of autumnal glory.</p>
			<p>I looked at an alder, laden with brown catkins, its blunt foliage stained with innumerable shades of lovely colour. Near it was a horse-chestnut, with but a few leaves hanging on its branches, and those a deep orange. The limes, I see, are already bare.</p>
			<p>Tonight the wind is loud, and rain dashes against my casement; tomorrow I shall awake to a sky of winter.</p>
