<p>I came home this afternoon just at twilight, and, feeling tired after
my walk, a little cold too, I first crouched before the fire, then let
myself drop lazily upon the hearthrug. I had a book in my hand,
and began to read it by the firelight. Rising in a few minutes,
I found the open page still legible by the pale glimmer of day. 
This sudden change of illumination had an odd effect upon me; it was
so unexpected, for I had forgotten that dark had not yet fallen. 
And I saw in the queer little experience an intellectual symbol. 
The book was verse. Might not the warm rays from the fire exhibit
the page as it appears to an imaginative and kindred mind, whilst that
cold, dull light from the window showed it as it is beheld by eyes to
which poetry has but a poor, literal meaning, or none at all?</p>
