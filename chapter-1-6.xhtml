<p>How many more springs can I hope to see? A sanguine temper
would say ten or twelve; let me dare to hope humbly for five or six.Â 
That is a great many. Five or six spring-times, welcomed joyously,
lovingly watched from the first celandine to the budding of the rose;
who shall dare to call it a stinted boon? Five or six times the
miracle of earth reclad, the vision of splendour and loveliness which
tongue has never yet described, set before my gazing. To think
of it is to fear that I ask too much.</p>
